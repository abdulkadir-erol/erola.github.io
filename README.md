ğŸ™ƒ Hello dear reader, Iâ€™m Kadir
I am a second-year MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at Georgia State University. I am advised by Dr. Ugur Kursuncu. My research interest broadly lies in multi-modal learning, machine learning, and generative AI.

I graduated from my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Engineering at Bilkent University.
